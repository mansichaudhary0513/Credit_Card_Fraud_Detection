# Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection

# 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection System

An intelligent Machine Learning–based system that detects fraudulent credit card transactions by analyzing transaction patterns and handling highly imbalanced financial data.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project focuses on identifying fraudulent transactions from a large dataset using classification algorithms and advanced data preprocessing techniques.  
The system improves fraud detection sensitivity by addressing class imbalance and optimizing evaluation metrics beyond traditional accuracy.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Detect fraudulent credit card transactions with high recall
- Handle extreme class imbalance in financial data
- Minimize false negatives to reduce financial risk
- Build a scalable fraud detection pipeline

---

## 🧠 Key Features

## 📊 Model Evaluation Metrics

Since the dataset is highly imbalanced, the following metrics were used:

- ✅ Precision  
- ✅ Recall  
- ✅ F1-score  
- ✅ Confusion Matrix  
- ✅ ROC-AUC Score  

---

## 🏆 Results

- Achieved **high accuracy with strong fraud detection recall**
- Significant improvement in detecting minority (fraud) class
- Reduced false negatives in transaction classification

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Class imbalance heavily affects model performance
- Recall is more important than accuracy in fraud detection
- SMOTE helps in improving fraud detection sensitivity
- Behavioral transaction patterns play a crucial role in identifying fraud
